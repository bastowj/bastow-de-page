# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes building web applications easier and more efficient. It provides a great developer experience with features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and more.

## Why Choose Next.js?

There are several reasons why Next.js has become a popular choice for building web applications:

- **Server-side Rendering (SSR)**: Next.js can render your pages on the server, which improves performance and SEO.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: You can generate static HTML at build time, which can be served from a CDN for maximum performance.
- **API Routes**: Next.js allows you to create API endpoints as part of your application.
- **File-based Routing**: The routing system is based on your file structure, making it intuitive and easy to understand.
- **Built-in CSS Support**: Next.js has built-in support for CSS modules, Sass, and other styling solutions.

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js application, you can use the `create-next-app` command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
```

This will set up a new Next.js project with all the necessary configurations.

## Creating Your First Page

In Next.js, pages are React components exported from files in the `pages` directory (or `app` directory if using the App Router). For example, to create a home page, you would create a file at `pages/index.js` or `app/page.js`:

```jsx
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my Next.js website!</h1>
      <p>This is my first Next.js page.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

Next.js provides a great foundation for building modern web applications. Its features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and file-based routing make it a powerful tool for developers.
